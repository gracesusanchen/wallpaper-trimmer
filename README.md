# wallpaper-trimmer

This is a bash script for automatically deleting images that do not have the specified dimensions, size, or resolution. It was written to keep my automatically updating wallpaper collection to a manageable size.

## Installation

Install ImageMagick for the `identify` utility.

| sudo apt-get install imagemagick

Install `fdupes`

| sudo apt-get install fdupes
